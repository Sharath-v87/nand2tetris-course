# nand2tetris-course
This repo contains all my codes which is done based on the nand2tetris course in coursera. This course is all about creating a computer starting from creating basic logic gates using nand gate. 

## Overview
* **Week 1** - Creating basic logic gates, multiplexer and de multiplexer using nand gates
* **Week 2** - Creating adders and ALU using previously built gates
* **Week 3** - Creating sequential logic circuits like a bit holder, register and RAM using all the combinational logic cicuits built previously
* **Week 4** - Creating asm files and testing them using CPU emulator
* **Week 5** - Creating memory, CPU and the Hack computer using previously built sequential and combination logic circuits
* **Week 6** - Creating a hack assembler to convert asm files to binary (I did it using python but one can use any language of their choice)
