# nand2tetris-course
This repo contains all of my codes which is done based on the lectures and materials provided by nand2tetris course in coursera. This course is all about creating a computer starting right from the creation of basic logic gates using nand gate. 

## Overview
* **Week 1** - Creating basic logic gates, multiplexer and de multiplexer using nand gates.
* **Week 2** - Creating adders and ALU using previously built gates.
* **Week 3** - Creating sequential logic circuits like a bit holder, register and RAM using all the combinational logic cicuits and D-flip flops built previously.
* **Week 4** - Creating asm files and testing them using CPU emulator.
* **Week 5** - Creating memory, CPU and the Hack computer using previously built sequential and combinational logic circuits based on the architecture given below.

* **Week 6** - Creating a hack assembler to convert asm files to binary based on the hack assembly language rules (I did it using python but one can use any language of their choice).
